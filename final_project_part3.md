# The Idea

## The project outline 
In this project, I want to show people the unique and surprising fact about my country,Thailand. Most people want to go to Thailand because of the tourism but I want to show other side of the country including culture and etc.

## A high-level summary of your project.  

What the readers want: 
As a reader, I want more knowledge about this country so that I can travel smartly. 
As a reader, I want to know about Thai culture so that I can talk to other people that I know.

Call for action : 
I can do this by planning a trip to Thailand 
I can do this by learning some Thai food 
I can do this by studying more Thai

## A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. 
This is the first draft of my user story.
![image](user_story_draft1.jpg)

I want to tell the story of someone who is considering to visit Thailand. The first hype emotion happens when the user sees the beautiful photo of Thailand. 
Then, the user has the questions in mind whether it's easy to travel ( Can people in Thailand speak English?, Is it safe to go?, Is it clean? ) Those questions lead to the downfall in the emotion. The turning point is dedunking the myst of the bad story in Thailand. After the user knows that Thailand is very unique and interesting country, the call for action comes.

I had the first discussion with collueges in the class with my first user story. The friend who had been to Thailand said that she wasn't worried about the language when going there. Therefore, I have reorganized the story to be 5 main parts.

1. Introduction (Make you feel excited and surprised on how popular Thailand is)
2. What can you expect from this country? (Cultural aspect in the country and some interesting myst about Thailand)
3. Is it safe to go? ( Well..I know that Thailand has so many very good and bad reputation about safety. Let's see which one is true.)
4. What do tourist usually do? (Give an a grisp of the feeling of visiting there)
5. Call to action (Book the tour! Mark Thailand as your next destination!)

## Data Source

First Draft
Tourism Data Set : https://data.world/payapdatasci/thai-tourism/workspace/file?filename=thaitourism2.csv << Showing the Tourism Stats
Global Destination Cities Index : https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GDCI-Global-Report-FINAL-1.pdf
Covid-19 Data Set : https://www.statista.com/statistics/1043366/novel-coronavirus-2019ncov-cases-worldwide-by-country/ << This is an interesting data because Thailand has a very low number of cases and we are coping the situation very well. I though that it's a way to imply that out country is safe.
