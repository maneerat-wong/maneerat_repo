# Recap Project Overview
In this project, I want to show people the unique and surprising fact about my country,Thailand.
Most people want to go to Thailand because of the tourism but I want to show other side of the country including culture and etc.

# Story Board
I do my storyboard on Shorthand because I will do my final presentation on the Shorthand. Therefore,it's easier for the user to see the overall flow as well.

| Who is the target audience of this story?                 | I think it's for the tourist who are looking for a place to travel during this situation(COVID-19)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Tourist/people who are looking for a vacation                                                                                                                               |                      |
| What is your first thought after seeing this story?       | Thailand is a very interesting choice for traveling in this suitaion because there are many interesting thing in Bangkok and the number of cases in Thailand is very low. For the map graph,I'm not sure what each dots represent. I'm also not sure the main message that you want to say from the covid-19 cases comparison graph. It seems that you want to say that Thailand has fewer number of cases but the trend seems to be the same as in the USA,S.Korea and EU. | thailand offers lots of interesting places and is still welcoming for tourist destination                                                                                   |                      |
| How do you feel after reading about the crime rate stats? | The crime rate is quite high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | I still feel unsafe since your description is for SEA but you don't provide any comparison for SEA. Instead, you compare against US and I feel US is pretty much dangerous. |                      |
| Did you find any graphics confusing?                      | Yes. There are many confusing graphs. The first graph on the traveling stats. I think that you want to point out that Bangkok has the highest number among other countries but there is no units on the Y-axis so I'm not sure what is the main message that you want to say.                                                                                                                                                                                               | The "Among all nationalities, American..." graph is too small.                                                                                                              |                      |
| What do you think about the flow of the story?            | The flow is interesting. You use the introduction with the inspiration then telling about the cuation or concerns during traveling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | I think it's good. Better add some description of places/food instead of just images.                                                                                       |                      |
| What would you change about this story?                   | Mostly the data vizualization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | If you have data for 2019 for first graph it will be better.                                                                                                                |                      |

| What is your first thought after seeing this story?       | Users understand that Thailand is still welcoming for traveling and it's a really interesting destination to go.                                                                                                                | Giving more description on food/places                                       |
| How do you feel after reading about the crime rate stats? | Users don't feel that it's safe to travel to Thailand because I compare it with USA which is the country with a high reputation of crime rate. Therefore, the message that Thailand is safe to travel is not persuasive at all. | Finding other comparison. For example, compare with the country in SEA       |
| Is anything surprising or confusing?                      | Users were confused on the map graph representing the distribution of the tourists. Also, the frist graph doesn't really tell users anything that Thailand is doing really well in tourism industry.                            | Revise the graph type of the tourist distribution graph and the first graph. |

# Next Step

This is the latest version of my draft : https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/blend-into-thailand/index.html
I will mainly work on the vizualization to make sure that I've delivered the persuasive and compelling message to my user.
Also, I hope to get more insightful thoughts during the revision in the class.
