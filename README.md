# About me
My name is Maneerat Wongjaroenporn (She,Her). I'm studying MISM-16 months program in Heinz College,Carnegie Mellon University.
I did my bachelor degree in engineering. Prior my master degree, I worked full-time in the consulting firm for both private and government sectors for almost 2 years.

Here are a few interesting things about me....
- I'm Thai. I was born and raised in Bangkok.
- I can speak 4 languages.
- I'm an obvious extrovert XD
- I played Trombone in the orchestra band for 3 years.
- I'm a board game master. My friends ask me every weekend to play with them.


# Career Goal
After graduation, I want to be a data scientist in the company where I can use my technical skills and business experience to find an impactful insight to improve the company performance. I believe that the soft skills like presentation and data visualization are going to enhance my ability to deliver the best outcome to the company.
